**`Back-End Developer`**

- "A criatividade, em ess√™ncia, √© o ato de dar vida a algo que far√° a diferen√ßa de forma n√£o convencional para um desafio proposto."
- "Creativity, at its core, is the act of giving life to something that will make a difference in an unconventional way for a given challenge."

The sentence above is the result of the definition I have reached and guides my steps. I am 22 years old, was born in the city of Dom Pedro, and I am currently studying Computer Science at the Federal University of Lavras, completing the 6th semester at the Polytechnic Institute of Bragan√ßa, in Portugal. In every stage I have completed, I am convinced that my presence was essential, not only to enrich my own journey but also that of those who were with me. Regarding creativity, I believe it goes beyond the content I produce on social media; it is about achieving the goals I have, and for that, technology is an essential tool. I love telling stories, which I also enjoy conveying through code and learning, because storytelling is not based solely on fantasy, but on the impact we generate and on what we cherish in the present.
